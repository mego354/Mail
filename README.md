# CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript - Project 3: Mail

## Project Overview

This project implements a single-page email client using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The client is designed to interact with a provided API to manage emails within a simulated inbox, sent mailbox, and archive.

## Features

### Send Mail
- Users can send an email using a form.
- The form data is sent via a POST request to `/emails`.
- After sending, the user is redirected to the "Sent" mailbox.

### Mailbox
- Users can view their Inbox, Sent mailbox, or Archive.
- Emails are fetched via GET requests to `/emails/<mailbox>`.
- Emails are displayed with the sender, subject, and timestamp.
- Unread emails are highlighted with a white background; read emails have a gray background.

### View Email
- Clicking an email opens a detailed view.
- Email details (sender, recipients, subject, timestamp, and body) are fetched via GET requests to `/emails/<email_id>`.
- The email is marked as read when viewed.
- The view includes buttons for archiving/unarchiving and replying to the email.

### Archive and Unarchive
- Users can archive/unarchive emails from the inbox.
- Archiving/unarchiving is managed via PUT requests to `/emails/<email_id>`.
- After updating, the user is redirected to the inbox.

### Reply
- Users can reply to an email using a "Reply" button.
- The reply form is pre-filled with the recipient, subject, and original email body.
- The subject is prefixed with "Re:" if not already present.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Run the Django Web Server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
2. **Register and Login**:
   - Open the web server in your browser.
   - Register a new account using the "Register" link.
   - Login with the registered account.

3. **Navigate the Interface**:
   - Use the navigation buttons to view different mailboxes.
   - Use the "Compose" button to create and send new emails.
